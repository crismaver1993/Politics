Last updated: August 27, 2024

At Wildpass, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy explains how we handle the information collected by the app, its use, and the measures we take to safeguard it.
1. Information We Collect

Wildpass collects and manages the following information:

    Location Coordinates: Wildpass accesses your GPS coordinates only when you use the help section for emergencies. This information is used to display your location and facilitate assistance, but it is not stored or sent to external servers; all information remains locally on your device.

    Camera Access: The app requires access to your deviceâ€™s camera to allow you to scan QR codes at mountain summits. This function is initiated manually by the user, and images are neither stored nor shared with third parties. Photos are used solely to complete challenges within the app.

2. Use of Information

The information collected by Wildpass is used exclusively for the following purposes:

    Emergencies: The GPS coordinates feature is only activated when you choose to use the help section in emergencies. The information is used to display your location on your device and is not transmitted elsewhere.

    QR Code Scanning: Images captured when scanning QR codes are processed locally to unlock content or register milestones within the app.

3. Data Security

Wildpass takes the security of your data very seriously. We implement reasonable security measures to protect the information stored locally on your device. Since Wildpass does not transmit data to external servers, the risk of data exposure is significantly minimized.
4. Information Sharing

We do not share your personal data with third parties. All information generated and handled by the app remains exclusively on your device and under your control.
5. Required Permissions

To function properly, Wildpass requires the following permissions:

    Location: Permission to access your precise location, used only in emergencies.
    Camera: Permission to use the camera, necessary for scanning QR codes at summits.

6. Data Retention

Wildpass does not store data long-term. All information generated is temporary and handled locally on your device while the app is in use.

We may update this privacy policy occasionally. We will notify you of any changes through the app so you are always informed about how we protect your privacy.
